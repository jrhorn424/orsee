# ICES Recruiter - ORSEE Implementation

## Server Setup
Familiarize yourself with the [Linode Documentation](http://library.linode.com/). The [Beginner's Guide](http://library.linode.com/beginners-guide) is a good place to start, but if you're already familiar with website administration, look at the [Getting Started Guide](http://library.linode.com/getting-started). If you're unfamiliar with administering a linux server, check out [Linux System Administration Basics](http://library.linode.com/using-linux/administration-basics). To turn the server into a webserver, have a look at the [LAMP Server](http://library.linode.com/lamp-guides/ubuntu-12.04-precise-pangolin) guide. This server was secured following the [Securing Your Server](http://library.linode.com/securing-your-server) guide.

If the server needs to be upgraded due to performance or disk space issues, it can be resized from the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com/). Alternatively, RAM, storage, IP addresses, and bandwidth can be purchased from the `Extras` tab in the Linode.

Currently, the server utilizes password-less SSH login, restricted to the user `jrhorn424`. This will need to be changed when another sysadmin takesover. To perform the transfer:
1. Create the new user, add to admin group.
2. Add the allowed user to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
3. Have the new user create an SSH key from their development machine. See the [OpenSSH Tutorial](http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/OpenSSH_Tutorial).
4. Add the `.pub` key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

Live volunteers can always be found on in the [Linode Channel on IRC](irc://#linode@irc.oftc.net).
